When starting this assignment on Inheritance, I was once again very intimidated by the tasks presented in the readme file. As I worked through what I needed to do in the House file, I ran into several challenges with attributes. This is because I wasn't sure on what would carry over from the Building file in the parent class. This was honestly the biggest challenge when working through all the files I needed to fill code inside of. There were also several instances where I needed to look things up that would allow me to do things like printing the collection in the library file (set). However, as I moved through the files, I got more used to the process as I was also able to look back on the things I had done previously and apply them to the file I was currently working on. Now that the assignment is finished, I can say that Inheritance is super useful in that it is more efficient since I don't need to constantly rewrite code and can just reference it. It also minimizes errors so that's another useful thing.
